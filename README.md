## ðŸ§  Background: What is Medical Malpractice Insurance?

**Medical malpractice insurance** protects healthcare professionals against legal claims arising from errors, negligence, or omissions in patient care. Commonly claimed areas include misdiagnosis, surgical errors, and prescription mistakes. 

Insurers and analysts use claim data to assess **risk exposure** across specialties, identify high-claim areas, and tailor policy premiums accordingly.
